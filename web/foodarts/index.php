				<h2 class="fa">The <em>Food Arts</em> Reader</h2>
				<hr class="fa">
				
				<p><i>Food Arts</i> reaches more than 55,500 chefs, F&amp;B directors and restaurant owners across the nation. Our readership covers the full&#45;service segment of the 
				industry as no other trade publication can; our readers represent operations from Perkins to TGI Friday's to fine&#45;dining establishments; from Holiday Inn to Hyatt 
				to Ritz&#45;Carlton.</p> 
				
				<p>Despite their diverse demographics, <i>Food Arts</i> readers share some "typical" traits which are anything but typical:</p>
				
				<ul style="list-style-image:url(../images/list-icon-8-1.gif)">
					<li><font color="#919342"><b>Power in Purchasing Decisions.</b></font> 95.2% of <i>Food Arts</i> readers are
					responsible for their establishment's FOOD purchasing decisions (MRI) and 98% are involved in and/or influence the Food, Beverage, Equipment and Tabletop 
					purchasing decisions (MRI).</li>
				
					<li><font color="#919342"><b>Power in Menu Decisions.</b></font> 94% are responsible for developing or influencing the addition of new items to their 
					establishment's menus (Harvey Measurement Study).</li>
				
					<li><font color="#919342"><b>Tremendous Purchasing Power.</b></font> <i>Food Arts</i> readers serve over 13 billion meals per year (MRI).</li>
				
					<li><font color="#919342"><b>Requests Food Arts in Writing.</b></font> <i>Food Arts</i> circulation is 100% written or emailed request (BPA). When other 
					publications speak of "readers," they often mean people to whom they send their publication. When we say "readers," we mean people who have taken time to 
					request <i>Food Arts</i> in writing.</li>
				
					<li><font color="#919342"><b>Overwhelming Response to Advertising.</b></font> <i>Food Arts</i> receives the highest leads within the industry and this 
					includes fractional advertising. Berkshire Processing reports that <i>Food Arts'</i> averages between 150-300 leads per ad, with BRC's receiving an average 
					of over 400 leads.</li>
				
					<li><font color="#919342"><b>Preference for <i>Food Arts</i> over other food service publications.</b></font> 96% of our readers have read the last 3 of our 
					4 issues and they spend an average of 54 minutes with each issue (MRI). The overwhelming majority of our readers spend more time with <i>Food Arts</i> than 
					with any other food service publication (MRI).</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				
				<h2 class="fa"><em>Food Arts</em> Editorial Mission</h2>
				<hr class="fa">
