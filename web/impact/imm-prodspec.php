				<p>In keeping with industry standards regarding digital ad delivery, M.Shanken Communications is now promoting PDF/X-1a as the preferred submission format for 
				all advertising files. In order to streamline the production process and improve the quality of the product, we will no longer be accepting files formatted in 
				their native application (such as QuarkXpress and Adobe Illustrator). We strongly encourage advertisers to become familiar with the PDF/X standard. For more 
				information regarding these file formats and for a list of software vendors and service bureaus that support them, 
				visit <a href="http://www.pdf-x.com" target="_blank"><b>http://www.pdf-x.com</b></a>.</p><br />

				<p>All material submitted to M.Shanken Communications should be accompanied by at least two proofs made from the final file. This proof should be generated using 
				a SWOP&#45;certified proofing system as indicated in the manufacturer's SWOP Application Data Sheet. Proofs that are not generated using a SWOP&#45;certified proofing 
				system or that do not meet SWOP specifications will not be used as color guidance. In the event that material is submitted without a SWOP&#45;certified proof, the 
				advertiser forfeits the right to challenge final color accuracy. For the current list of SWOP&#45;certified proofing systems and the complete SWOP specifications<br /> 
				visit <a href="http://www.swop.org" target="_blank"><b>http://www.swop.org</b></a>.</p>
				
				<p>All proofs must contain color control bars in order to be considered an acceptable SWOP proof. All color control bars should have the following characteristics:</p>

						in the same 25%, 50% and 75% tint values are required. Additional tint value areas such as 1%, 2%, 3%, 5% and 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% are
						strongly recommended.</li>
						
						<li>A gray balance bar must be included on the proof designed to match the neutral appearance and weight of black tints of three different
						values, under standard viewing conditions.</li>
						
						<li>The three-color gray balance portion of the color bar should have the following values:</li>
