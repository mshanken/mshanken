<h3>Transactions and E-Commerce</h3><p>During your visit to our Sites you may elect to engage in a transaction involving the purchase of a product, such as a subscription to Wine Spectator Magazine, a print or online advertisement or other tangible goods and services. To serve you most efficiently, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are often handled by a third party processing agent, bank or distribution institution. While in most cases, transactions are completed without difficulty, there is no such thing as &quot;perfect security&quot; on the Internet or offline. If you&#39;re concerned about online credit card safety, in most cases a telephone number will be made available so you can call us and place your order by phone. M. Shanken Communications cannot take responsibility for the success or security of transactions undertaken or processed by third parties.</p>
<p>On occasion, a product or service may not be available at the time or the price as it appears in an advertisement. In such event, or in the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error, technology effort, error in the date or length of publication, or error in pricing or product information received from our advertisers or suppliers, you agree M. Shanken Communications is not responsible for such errors or discrepancies.</p>
<h3>Other Specifics About Interactive Areas (Comments, Ratings, Message Boards, Chat Areas, Automated Posting of Classified or Other Advertising, etc.)</h3><p>Sites’ comments sections, ratings, forums, chat rooms and other such interactive areas are provided to give users an interesting and stimulating forum to express their opinions and share ideas and information. Given the nature and the volume of messages and postings, M. Shanken Communications cannot and does not monitor all of the material posted or transmitted by users and third party information providers. To protect your safety, please use your best judgment when using these forums. We particularly discourage divulging personal phone numbers and addresses or other information that can be used to identify or locate you. If you make such disclosures either through comments, postings on the forums, chat rooms, in classified advertising you place or in other interactive areas, or to third parties in any communication, you do so fully understanding the consequences of such disclosures and with a knowing consent that such information could be used to identify you. M. Shanken Communications reserves the right to delete, move or edit any communications at any time, for any reason or in its discretion, but has no obligation to review or remove any such content.</p>
