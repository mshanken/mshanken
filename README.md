##Making changes
Create a branch to start working in you new changes. Do not work in the gh-pages when updating harp files

##Updating Master
After you made your changes merge your changes into master and create a pull request or simply pull if you have the right privilages

##Updating gh-pages
Once you have committed your changes checkout gh-pages and merge your updates from master now lets build gh-pages static content ```harp compile _site ./``` check your gh-pages brach for updated static content. Once you confirm your changes are in place commit your changes to gh-pages ```git push origin master``` to update the mshanken site at github.
