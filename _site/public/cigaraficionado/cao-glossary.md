- The ratio of clicks to impressions;
- Represented by the following equation:<br /><br />
<u><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of clicks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x 100<br />number of impressions</b>
		
- For example, if an ad receives 1,000 clicks out of 100,000 impressions, the ad's CTR equals 1%

- The approximate percentage of time an ad will appear on a Web site;
- For example, if an advertiser purchased 100,000 impressions out of a total 1 million impressions for a given time frame, this advertisers ad will display approximately 10% of the time; this advertiser will therefore have an approximate 10% Share of Voice
