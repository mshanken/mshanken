#WhiskyFest&trade;
---

WhiskyFest is the longest-running and best-attended whisky
festival in the U.S. It is unique, offering the finest whiskies
from all around the world, poured by the people — the very
living legends — who make them. It was created by Whisky
Advocate magazine and continues to improve and benefit
through the extensive knowledge and industry savvy of the
magazine’s editors and writers.

##Your Audience
---

WhiskyFest attracts a wide range of affluent attendees, from
the excited novice to seasoned enthusiasts. What brings them
together at WhiskyFest is a desire to learn more, know more,
experience more about whisky. That same desire draws large
numbers of people from the trade: wholesalers, retailers,
importers, and mixologists. WhiskyFest is also well-attended
by journalists representing the most influential print and
online media.

##Top Whisky Markets
---
These events offer unsurpassed opportunities to reach top,
targeted audiences with a significant echo effect in America’s
most influential cities: Chicago, San Francisco and New York.
As we like to say: WhiskyFest — The First, The Best!

##How Will You Connect?
---

WhiskyFest has two sides, two opportunities to connect
with this audience of influencers. The Grand Tasting is a gala
atmosphere of wide-eyed variety, the perfect arena for a
stand-out brand with a charismatic ambassador. The Seminars
offer a quiet, focused venue for your message to a smaller,
self-selected group who are looking to learn much more, to
become ambassadors.

>“It was first class all the way and definitely an event that I’m going to continue to partake in.”
