##Welcome to the world of Whisky!

Whisky has made a huge comeback over the past fifteen years, and Whisky Advocate has been there to cover it all. Published quarterly in a lovingly luxurious style, we’re the world’s top source for whisky information, education, and entertainment. This is where the world’s foremost whisky writers send their best work to cover the entire category: Scotch, Irish, Bourbon, Rye, Canadian, Japanese, and the exploding Craft niche.

Our 200,000+ readers are male (96%), highly educated (96% college educated, 41% post-graduate study), and many work in executive or professional positions (40%). The average HHI is an impressive $175,000, and most spend generously on whisky, luxury cars, golf, and travel (55% travel to Europe). Many of our readers are actually in the whisky industry, and our reviews are well-respected and widely quoted.

As the interest in whisky has blazed alive across the globe, Whisky Advocate has fanned the flames with the in-depth information astute drinkers crave. For people who plan their vacations on the Bourbon Trail, who fly-fish in the River Spey in the morning and tour Scotch distilleries in the afternoon, who spend tens of thousands investing in rare whiskies, no other magazine will do.
