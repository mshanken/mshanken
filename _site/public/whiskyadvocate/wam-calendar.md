###Spring (March) 2015 — Travel to Scotland
---

All aboard the Royal Scotsman! The whisky-trimmed elegance of this fabled train is just one of the
attractions in our Scottish travel issue. We’ll take you sailing on the distillery coast, visit the best visitor
centers, stay in the best whisky inns, and take a roaring road trip up Scotland’s Thunder Road, the A9.
Then we’re back to America to look at new things in bourbon country and the big fuss over whisky
regulations. We’ll feast on smoked game, play midnight golf, and go drinking with Inspector Rebus.
And don’t forget: it’s also our annual Awards Issue.

###Summer (June) 2015 — Whisky and Beer

Learn how brewers are aging beers in whisky barrels (and vice versa), making whisky directly
from beer, brewing beers with the smoky malts whisky makers use, and pushing super-beers into
whisky ranges of alcohol. We’ll celebrate Ardbeg’s bicentenary, meet some ‘proper’ distillery
managers, and count off the people who made whisky what it is today. Then it’s 48 Hours in
Philly, a taste of Scottish chocolates, and advice on how to store your whisky.

##Fall (September) 2015 — Looking for Whisky Value

“Value” is a tricky word; you can find it in low-priced whisky and in expensive ones. We’ll help you
find them with pieces like the 100 best whiskies under $100. Learn why bourbon got so pricey so
fast, how much of your whisky price is taxes, and where the last great value sector is in whisky.
We’ll go hunting and fishing in Scotland, taste unusually smoked whiskeys, and view the 7 wonders
of Irish whiskey. Then it’s 48 Hours in Paris, tips for finding whisky value and more.

###Winter (December) 2015 — Bourbon!
---

Bourbon is exploding, and there’s no end in sight: more drinkers, more cocktails, more distillers,
more bottlings! We’ll check in on innovation (and consistency) at the majors, visit some of the
new makers, and celebrate bottled in bond. Add our usual blend of world whisky stories, travel
and food focuses, and bountiful harvest of whisky reviews at this time of year, and you’ve got an
issue you won’t want to miss!
