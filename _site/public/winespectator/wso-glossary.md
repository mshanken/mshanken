- The ratio of clicks to impressions
	
- Represented by the following equation:<br /><br />
**<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of clicks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x 100<br />number of impressions**
		
- For example, if an ad receives 1,000 clicks out of 100,000 impressions, the ad's CTR equals 1%
