## Mission Statement
---

*Market Watch* is the primary resource for business information for the drinks industry, providing extensive analysis of industry trends, data, statistics, 
on- and off-premise operations, as well as coverage of business strategies, merchandising promotion and wholesale news.

As the link between the supplier and trade, *Market Watch* has a major influence on the degree to which the retailer understands, respects and acknowledges product 
in today's competitive and volatile business environment.

Open state retailers and control state personnel are more responsive than ever to direct brand communications. The trade tier is openly seeking assertive actions 
on the part of suppliers. 

The time to establish effective and continuing rapport with the trade is now!
